# h-n.me

This is a reimagined version of the original h-n.me site, which was built on the recently-removed Heroku free tier. That site held dozens of projects, including a URL shortener at the root that could only be edited directly through the REST API. The homepage featured a simple splash page animation, and nothing else. This updated version is designed to be much more stable, living serverless on AWS and featuring a user interface for the first time. The appearance is inspired heavily by the original site's splash page.

This frontend is built on Next.js and Tailwind. The backend is built on Serverless and AWS Lambda (not currently contained in this repository).
